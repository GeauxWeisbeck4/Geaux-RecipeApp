## About Andrew and Lisa

#### What do you get when you cross a Native American-French-German-British-Nordic-Italian-Etc. male with a British female?

This awesome cookbook is what you get! Lisa and Andrew are very different DNA wise, which allows for them to whip up some awesomely diverse recipes - yet, they are similar enough to have the same kind of tastes. They both enjoy the finer things in life and have kick-ass taste buds.

Lisa's experience with working in the food industry and Andrew's love for smoking marijuana (plus both of their love for tasty food) make them ideal chefs when whipping up some delicious home recipes. Lisa has a lot of random recipes that she figured out through her experience in working at restaurants. Andrew has a lot of Cajun recipes and then random recipes as well.

## A message from the Chefs

"We hope you enjoy our little online cookbook that we have put together with the hope that you too can make these delicious dishes at home and enjoy them as much as we have. Everything we cook gets a special ingredient you can't buy at the store - a gallon of love, poured out from our hearts into every dish we make for each other. We cook for each other, not for ourselves, and we relish the wonderful moments we share together in the kitchen and at the dinner table.

Let us know if any of our recipes has become a staple in your household or just something that hit you right and you had shout "OOOHH MAMA!"; maybe it was so good, you had to stand up and slap somebody next to you. 

Enjoy cooking and savoring these delicious crafts we have added to our cookbook, just for you :) !"
